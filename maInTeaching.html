            <h2>MA IN TEACHING</h2>
            <p>
                MAT @ AUCA:The AUCA MAT builds upon the innovative MAT model of Bard College, New York, and seamlessly
                integrates four components: foundational education theories, disciplinary content knowledge, mentored
                practicum in pedagogy, and academic and action research. The curriculum balances content area pedagogy
                with understanding of learning and adolescent development. Courses are taught by AUCA faculty, and by
                faculty from Bard College in New York as well as from the Bard Global Network.

                The AUCA MAT program partners with the US Embassy in Bishkek to provide four (4) scholarships to highly
                deserving applicants from the diverse regions of the Kyrgyz Republic. Applicants who qualify for this
                scholarship will be those outside of Bishkek, particularly in language diverse areas or among ethnic
                minorities, who already teach in or will commit to teaching in public schools in such regions.

                In addition to admitting current teachers, the AUCA MAT program also admits candidates who are aspiring
                to become school teachers. The program offers courses that address significant issues of the Central
                Asian educational context – for example courses on inclusive education, multicultural education and
                identity, and on law, society and sustainable development. Participants are required to defend a thesis
                and pass a comprehensive exam to graduate with the teaching license from the Kyrgyz Ministry of
                Education.

                AUCA MAT is a 2-year, six-semester program – summer, fall, spring — where the summer semester classes
                are held on campus, and the fall and spring semesters embody a blended learning approach. Thus, for the
                fall and spring semesters, the program combines on-line lectures and consultations with face-to-face,
                on-campus coursework over one full week at the AUCA campus.

                This blended approach enables AUCA MAT candidates to continue their jobs in schools (if they are
                in-service candidates) or undergo extensive practice teaching (if they are pre-service candidates) in a
                partner school. The time spent in the classroom by program participants is structured for mentored
                practice and for conducting classroom research. The mentored practicum and classroom research are
                integrated with coursework in disciplinary content and pedagogy. Such a program structure ensures that
                active work in classrooms is a consistent frame of reference for AUCA MAT candidates throughout the
                academic year and that they graduate from the program as teachers who understand the connection between
                their discipline and teaching practice.

                The blended approach also enables colleagues from the Bard Global Network to engage as contributing
                faculty to the AUCA MAT program. The AUCA MAT program has already enlisted contributing faculty members
                from Bard New York and Al-Quds Bard.
